Lay down
Time that I do it your way
Hush boy, you ain't gotta make a sound
Come on baby
Put it here boy, don't be scared
'Bout to get up in your head tonight
Play me like an X-Box
It's your call of duty
Tear down these walls
Or you can play me like a PS3
Control all my levels
Turn me up, put it down
Drop your guard, boy

Please don't fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it
Baby it's just you and me
Meet me here in XTC
Let me ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it
In this game, can you be number one?
Then show me what you got
Meet me at the top
Baby if you hit the spot
So don't fight it
Baby it's just you and me

Meet me here in XTC

Maybe
You can throw me down the stairs
Hold my back and pull my hair tonight
Oh baby
We ain't gotta stop
'Til the break of light
The moves we make
When we connect
Feeling your skin when we undress
Got you so damn close
Body to body

Boy you got my love comin' down
Go ahead and turn me out

Boy don't fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it
Baby it's just you and me
Meet me here in XTC
Let me ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it
In this game can you be number one?
Then show me what you got
Meet me at the top
Baby if you hit the spot
So don't fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it
Baby it's just you and me
Meet me here in XTC

Boy don't fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it
Baby it's just you and me
Meet me here in XTC
Let me ride it, ride it, ride it, ride it
In this game can you be number one?
Then show me what you got
Meet me at the top
Baby if you hit the spot
So don't fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it
Baby it's just you and me
Meet me here in XTC
