Generation ecstacy

C'mon and open your mind look inside you're sure to find garden of tranquility
It's waiting there for you, for me
Come on, intrude into, the real feeling that tuns you on
Soundless vibrations nation elation of ethereal song
Walk into the wilderness of your mind take control of your destiny
Love was the past, nowlove will be the future
